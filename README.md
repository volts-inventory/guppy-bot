To use:

You need a OpenAI and Discord APP API key. 

Invite the APP from discord applications dashboard to the discord server you want to use. 

Create a channel in the discord server called "gupp_chat", this is where it will respond. 

On main computer/server that will run this code, export keys to ENV vars OPENAPI_KEY and DISCORD_KEY

eg.

export OPENAPI_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
export DISCORD_KEY=xxxxxxxxx

and run with 

"python3 discord_main.py"
